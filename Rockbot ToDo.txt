things we can do now:
	- Character Controller
	- Shoot Projectiles (direction vector points to mouse location)
	- Single texture sprites (no animations yet)
	- Background ( Parallax effects )
	- Level Generation? (Platforms, etc)
	- Enemy spawner (from right/left side of screen maybe. Simply spawn object for now and have 	it move a single direction towards you)
	- Camera follow character. (Pan camera left/right/up/down based on character x and y positions)
